## A/B deployment

A blue/green deployment is a change management strategy for releasing software code. Blue/green deployments, which may also be referred to as A/B deployments require two identical hardware environments that are configured exactly the same way. While one environment is active and serving end users, the other environment remains idle.

## A/B test

As explained by Wikipedia A / B Testing is comparing two version of the same subject and measuring the resultant responses. Chevy or Ford? Both are car makers, both make sedans, both have 4 doors and seat families. One has tinted windows while the other has a fancy radio. Which do you pick? Congrats, you have just been exposed to A / B Testing (contrived, I know, but you get the point I hope). Two very similar things, slightly different, measure user response rate.
