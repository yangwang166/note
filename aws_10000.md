# AWS from 10,000 meters

Region
* Physically region

Availability Zone
* Data Center

Edge Network / Regional Edge Caches
* For CloudFront
* Like CDN

## Compute Service

EC2

EC2 Container Service
* docker

Elastic Beanstalk:
* upload code, focus on code, will auto using load balancing
* developer associate / devops pro
* not much in solution architect associate

Lambda:
* no worry about the underlying physical or virtual machines
* only manage your code
* eg, a Lambda function that puts the text over the top, and it triggered asap somebody uploads n images to your web site
* in solution arch associate and developer associate
* severless
