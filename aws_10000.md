# AWS from 10,000 meters

Region
* Physically region

Availability Zone
* Data Center

Edge Network / Regional Edge Caches
* For CloudFront
* Like CDN

## Compute Service

EC2

EC2 Container Service
* docker

Elastic Beanstalk:
* upload code, focus on code, will auto using load balancing
* developer associate / devops pro
* not much in solution architect associate

Lambda:
* no worry about the underlying physical or virtual machines
* only manage your code
* eg, a Lambda function that puts the text over the top, and it triggered asap somebody uploads n images to your web site
* in solution arch associate and developer associate
* severless
* eg, note->website->mp3 with different voices->stream to phone->turn the note which alexa can read

Lightsail
* VPS, virtual private service
* don't want to understand anything about the aws underlying: VPC, security group.
* Provision the server, give you a fixed IP that you can login to it
* RDP for windows, ssh for linux
* Also have a cool management console
* like EC2

Batch
* Batch computing
* Not in any certification

## Storage

S3
* Simple Storage Service
* Bucket, you upload your files into buckets

EFS
* Elastic File System
* NAS: Network attached Storage
* Storage file in EFS volume, and mount that to multiple VM

Glacier
* Data archival
* very very cheap
* data store there usually be check once a year

Snowball
* the way to bring in large amount of data into aws data center
* rather than transmitting it over the broadband
* write physically to disk and send the disk to AWS data center and imported manually
* in solution associate and developer associate

Storage Gateway
* install in your data center or office, replicate data back to S3
* 4 types of storage gates
* in solution associate and developer associate

## Databases

RDS
* Relational Databases Services
* Mysql(Aurora), Postgres, SQL Server, Oracle

DynomoDB
* No relational DB

Elasticache
* cache thing you commonly queried things from you databases
* Like a online store you want to cache your top 10 products

Red Shift
* Data warehousing
* BI
* Do complex query
* a lot of joins

## Migration

AWS Migration Hub
* Tracking service that allows you to track your application as you migrate them
to AWS and integrates with other services within the migration framework
* like keep track on `DB migration Services` or `server migration service`
* visualising your migration

Application Discovery Services
* automated set of tools
* detects what application you have
* and what their dependencies
* eg share point server, depends on SQL server and domain controller

Database migration Services
* Oracle hate it when it released
* a easy way to migrate your db on-prem to AWS

Server Migration Services
* Migrate your virtual and physical servers to AWS

Snowball(also here)
* migrating amount of data into cloud

## Networking and Content Delivery

VPC
* Amazon virtual private cloud
* like a virtual data center
* config firewalls, availability zones config
* config network aside address ranges
* config network route table
* complicated, but very important, fundamental important, yes
* in all associate certificate
* understand it inside out

CloudFront
* content delivery network, CDN

Route53
* DNS Services
* both need in all associate

API Gateway
* important in developer associate, also in solution architect associate
* create server-less website (like using poly)
* create your own api as for your other services to talk to

Direct Connect
* important in solution architect associate
* a way to running a dedicated line from either your corporate head office or from your datacenter directly into amazon and will directly connect into your VPC

## Developer Tools (atm, not a single service inside it involved in developer associate certificate)

CodeStar
* a way of getting a group of developer working together quite easily
* project managing your code
* continuous delivery toolchain
* release your code in a minute
* collaborating with other developer who are working

CodeCommit
* store your code
* source control services
* private git repository

CodeBuild
* compile your code
* run test against it
* provide software packages that are ready to deploy

CodeDeploy
* deploy services
* deploy your app into ec2 instance or on-prem instances, also lambda function

CodePipeline
* continuous delivery services
* use that sort of model and visualise and automate

X-Ray
* debug
* analyse your server-less application
* requests tracing, can go in and find out the root cause of issue and performance bottlenecks

Cloud9
* IDE inside aws console
